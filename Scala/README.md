# ScalaSudoku
A sudoku solver written in Scala, as a small project for learning the language. 
Takes as an input a filename describing the original puzzle, with a row of 9 characters
per line, where each character is one of '1' .. '9', or a '_' (underscore) for lines
of unknown value.

This is just a learning exercise, don't expect much from it.
